Apple Inc. used to be called Apple Computer, Inc., but Apple changed their name after introducing the original iPhone.[5]\nApple Inc. is a public company and trades on the NASDAQ under the stock ticker AAPL. iPad[change | change source]\nThe iPad is a tablet computer, similar to the iPhone and iPod Touch but with a much larger display - while a typical iPhone has a screen about 4 to 5 inches in size, iPads have screens from 8 to 12\xa0inches big. Apple products used to ship with chargers and EarPods, but recently Apple has removed the chargers and EarPods from the boxes of most of their products to make the packaging smaller.', 'In total, Apple occupies almost 40% of the available office space in the city.[278]\nApple\'s headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) are located in Cork in the south of Ireland, called the Hollyhill campus.[279] The facility, which opened in 1980, houses 5,500 people and was Apple\'s first location outside of the United States.[280] Apple\'s international sales and distribution arms operate out of the campus in Cork.[281]\nApple has two campuses near Austin, Texas: a 216,000-square-foot (20,100\xa0m2) campus opened in 2014 houses 500 engineers who work on Apple silicon[282] and a 1.1-million-square-foot (100,000\xa0m2) campus opened in 2021 where 6,000 people work in technical support, supply chain management, online store curation, and Apple Maps data management.\n As of the end of 2021[update], this broad line of products comprises about 11% of the company\'s revenues.[1]\nAt WWDC 2023, Apple introduced its new VR headset, Vision Pro, along with visionOS.[188] Apple announced that it will be partnering with Unity to bring existing 3D apps to Vision Pro using Unity\'s PolySpatial technology.[189][190][191][192]\nServices\nApple offers a broad line of services, including advertising in the App Store and Apple News app, the AppleCare+ extended warranty plan, the iCloud+ cloud-based data storage service, payment services through the Apple Card credit card and the Apple Pay processing platform, digital content services including Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and the iTunes Store.\n According to Bloomberg, the headset may come out in 2023.[173] Further insider reports state that the device uses iris scanning for payment confirmation and signing into accounts.[174]\nOn June 18, 2022, the Apple Store in Towson, Maryland became the first to unionize in the U.S., with the employees voting to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.[175]\nOn July 7, 2022, Apple added Lockdown Mode to macOS 13 and iOS 16, as a response to the earlier Pegasus revelations; the mode increases security protections for high-risk users against targeted zero-day malware.[176]\nApple launched a buy now, pay later service called \'Apple Pay Later\' for its Apple Wallet users in March 2023. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]\nThe Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]\n The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company\'s history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple\'s stock price.[55]:\u200a117–129\u200a During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[56] Gassée left the company later that year.[57]\n1990–1997: Decline and restructuring\nThe company pivoted strategy and in October 1990 introduced three lower-cost models, the Macintosh Classic, the Macintosh LC, and the Macintosh IIsi, all of which saw significant sales due to pent-up demand.[58]']

Final Response: Bananas are a nutritious fruit known for their high sugar content, making them a great energy source. They are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin C, and potassium. A small banana or half a cup of sliced banana contains about 2.6 grams of dietary fiber, 8.8 mg of vitamin C, and 363 mg of potassium.

Fresh and ripe bananas are the most nutritious option, while green bananas are less digestible due to proteins that inhibit amylase, an enzyme needed for digesting complex carbohydrates. Cooking methods like broiling or frying can enhance their sweetness and aroma without significantly altering their texture.

Bananas can also be dried or frozen; however, drying concentrates their nutrients and calories, and frozen bananas should be thawed in the refrigerator to avoid browning. When buying bananas, look for ones that will ripen appropriately for your planned consumption, avoiding overripe or cold-damaged ones. 

Overall, bananas offer a convenient and delicious way to boost your nutrient intake!

Final Response: Bananas are a nutritious fruit that serves as a handy energy source due to their high sugar content. They are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin C, and potassium. A small banana contains about 2.6 grams of dietary fiber, 8.8 mg of vitamin C, and 363 mg of potassium. 

The best way to consume bananas is when they are fresh and ripe, as green bananas contain antinutrients that can inhibit digestion. Cooking methods such as broiling or frying enhance their sweetness and aroma while preserving most of their nutrition. 

When it comes to processing, drying bananas concentrates their nutrients, while freezing can alter their color if not done properly. When buying bananas, select ones with a yellow skin and brown specks for immediate use, or those that are mostly yellow with a bit of green for a couple of days later. Avoid overripe bananas or those with damage from cold storage.
